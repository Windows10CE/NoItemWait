# NoItemWait
Removes the wait between a chest opening and being able to pick up an item by making them drop instantly, getting rid of the small delay between hitting the ground and being able to be picked up, and increasing the range at which items are picked up automatically (except lunars).

Disablable through configs, and you can change the range of automatic pickups to anything you want, or the base game value.

Works on servers/hosts while the clients do not have the mod with https://thunderstore.io/package/frostycpu/UnmoddedVersion/.
